# tcpholepunchclient
A TCP hole-punching client made to interface with a simple Python introducer


This client is made to interface with the hole-punching "introducer" server in [this python nat-hole-punching repository](https://github.com/dwoz/python-nat-hole-punching). The repository also links to a very thorough explanaition of nat-hole-punching.

To run this console hole-punching proof of concept, you will require the address (ip:port) of your introducer server.
